## Introduction

With the rapid advancements in social computing, multimedia, and sensing technology, Affective Computing research have provoked more discussion about the potential consequences of intelligent AI equipped with emotional intelligence. Affective computing research is engaged with ethics at different stages, from training of emotionally intelligent models with enormous amount of human data to deploying the code in application specific environment. In principal, the development of any AI system must be guided by a concern for its human impact. The aim should be striving to augment and enhance humans, not replace human; while taking inspiration from human intelligence. The problem arises when in some areas especially for data protection and research with human participants; when explicit codes give the AI system legal force and it impact human implicitly/explicitly. To this end, Responsible AI address this issue by analyzing its potential implications and enhance technology in a privacy preserving way. The REACT 2023 workshop aims to transfer the same concept to small-scale, lab based environment to real-world, large-scale corpus enhanced with responsibility. The workshop also focuses to bring attention of the researchers and industry professionals on the potential implications of Emotional-AI developments, and evaluating the moral and ethical consequences. 


## Call for Contributions

### Full Workshop Papers

The 1st International Workshop on Responsible Affective computing (REACT 2023) at <a href="https://www.acmmm2023.org/" target="_blank">ACM-MM 2023</a> (track for Multimodal and Responsible Affective Computing) aims to encourage and highlight novel strategies for affective phenomena estimation and prediction with a focus on robustness and accuracy in extended parameter spaces, spatially, temporally, spatio-temporally and most importantly Responsibly. This is expected to be achieved by applying novel neural network architectures, incorporating anatomical insights and constraints, introducing new and challenging datasets, and exploiting multi-modal training. Specifically, the workshop topics include (but are not limited to):

- Privacy preserving large scale data collection and annotation for Affective Computing.
- Privacy preserving large scale emotion recognition in the wild.
- Responsible AI for emotion recognition.
- Privacy preserving fusion techniques for audio-visual/physiological signals.
- Privacy preserving localization and identification of salient affect signals.
- Privacy preserving applications in healthcare domain (mental health, rehab robotics etc). 
- Affective Computing Applications in education and entertainment.
- Privacy concerns in large scale data collection.
- Explainable AI in affective computing.
- Responsible Personalization of affective phenomena estimators with low data regime.
- Bias in affective computing data (e.g. lack of multi-cultural datasets).
- Algorithmic bias and fairness in affective computing.

<br>

We will be accepting the submission of full unpublished and original papers. These papers will be peer-reviewed via a double-blind process, and will be published in the official workshop proceedings and be presented at the workshop itself. 

#### Submission 
We invite authors to submit unpublished papers (6 to 8 page <a href="https://www.acmmm2023.org/instructions/" target="_blank">ACM-MM format</a>) to our workshop, to be presented at a oral/poster session upon acceptance. All submissions will go through a double-blind review process. All contributions must be submitted (along with supplementary materials, if any) at this <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/REACT2023/Submission/Index" target="_blank">CMT link</a>. Accepted papers will be published in the official ACM-MM Workshops proceedings.

#### Note
Authors of previously rejected main conference submissions are also welcome to submit their work to our workshop. When doing so, you must submit the previous reviewers' comments (named as previous\_reviews.pdf) and a letter of changes (named as letter\_of\_changes.pdf) as part of your supplementary materials to clearly demonstrate the changes made to address the comments made by previous reviewers.

        Prof. Hatice Gunes is a Professor of Affective Intelligence and Robotics at University of Cambridge's Department of Computer Science and Technology. Her research interests are in the areas of affective computing and social signal processing that lie at the crossroad of multiple disciplines including, computer vision, signal processing, machine learning, multimodal interaction and human-robot interaction. Her current research vision is to embrace the challenges present in the area of health and empower the lives of people through creating socio-emotionally intelligent technology. This vision has been supported by three new projects funded by prestigious and competitive grants via the WorkingAge Project funded by the EU H2020 Programme, the EPSRC Fellowship Programme and the Turing Faculty Fellowship Programme.
